# internal-audit-phishing
Creating internal audit Phishing Emails that notify the "Manager" when an employee fails.
This operates off of python code that runs the exact same as the pico I have listed as well, so the set up will be required from that README found here > https://github.com/S3it4/internal-audit-pico/edit/main/README.md
Once this is completed, continue:

Save the .py as whatever you want, can save it in its own folder and directory. This directory will need to be referenced in the Script in the HTML.

*PLEASE SEE THE HTML SCRIPT FILE*

Edit your HTML code accordingly, then save the html code to its respective location.

This operates by using ActiveXObject which is tech for Internet Explorer, so the HTML will need to be opened in Internet Explorer to run the script.
